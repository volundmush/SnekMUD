## INTRO
A while back I came into possession of the code for a game I love, written atop of ye olde CircleMUD.

Maybe, one day, this library will be able to serve as a foundation for a port of it.

This isn't a usable game by itself; it's a framework/SDK upon which one would create a more specific type of game along the style of CircleMUD.
